Cremming awesome video game / series in development

## Ok so here's the plan:
- I'd like to make this an entire cosmere video game (possibly a series) 
- Mistborn should be easiest to pull off seeing as it's the easiest to code.
	- I'll probably start with the basic metals & alloys from the first series; I want it to take place prior to the events of TFE with some of the events of Secret History as well.
		- Hoid should DEFINITELY make an appearance
- Stormlight Archive is going to be more difficult because there's weird stuff involved there but I suppose its investiture shouldn't be too difficult to pull off either.
