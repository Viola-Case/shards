# **Shards**

>Viola Case-son-son-Brackeys, Truthless of Unity, wore sweatpants on the day he was to code a king.

## Ok so here's the plan:

- I'd like to make this an entire Cosmere video game (possibly a series) and get BrandoSando involved either for consultation

- Mistborn should be easiest to pull off seeing as it's the easiest to code.

	- I'll probably start with the basic metals & alloys from the first series; I want it to take place prior to the events of TFE with some of the events of Secret History as well.

		- Hoid should DEFINITELY make an appearance

- Stormlight Archive is going to be more difficult because there's weird stuff involved there but I suppose its investiture shouldn't be too difficult to pull off either.

	- Most surgebinding should be pretty easy to do, but some will probably be more difficult.

- The other places I'd like to turn into DLCs because they are less prominent (Elantris is kinda small ngl)
